# SOEN422-FINAL-PROJECT
This project aims to allow students an opportunity to practice a port of a virtual machine (VM) to smallfootprint embedded systems: the Arduino Nano. The VMâ€™s instruction set is tailored to support a subset (operators, basic statements var/if/while, and functions) of a subset of the Edison programming language, intended for a restrictive microcontroller environment ATmega368P 8-bit microcontroller with 32K bytes Flash and 2K bytes SRAM. This project will require six (6) tasks to incrementally achieve the port on target
